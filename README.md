# Deep-Learning-Project
Here is a link to file that needs to be uploaded in order to use Google's pretrained word2vec model https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?resourcekey=0-wjGZdNAUop6WykTtMip30g
This file must be uploaded to colab manually in order to use it


To run the thumbnail CNN:

First, download the zipped file 'data.zip' which can be accessed through the link in the file titled "Thumbnail Data".
Then, open the DeepLearningProjectThumbnail.ipynb.
Upload the file 'data.zip' locally.
Run 'Required Imports' cell.
Skip the classifying methods since the data is already sorted in the zip file I provided; simply go down to the "unzip file" cell and run every cell below 
it besides the ones that say not to run.
It takes 6 hours so have fun!
